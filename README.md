# Python Programming
This repository contain my experiment using Python programming language:

## Environment and installation
Creates the environment, then activates it and installs dependencies. [One go](setup.bat)  or [manual](setup.md)
   
## Versioning
The project uses semantic versioning, with the version number defined in the `__init__.py` file as `__version__`. This makes it easy to track the current version of the project directly in the code.
The project version is specified in the `__init__.py` file, located in the main package directory:

```python
# your_package/__init__.py
__version__ = "0.0.2"
```

## Changelog
For tracking changes across versions, the project should includes a CHANGELOG.md file. Hereâ€™s an example format:
```
# Changelog
## [0.0.2] - YYYY-MM-DD
### Added
- Add files
- Implemented feature number AAA.
- Fixed issue number FFF.

## [0.0.1] - YYYY-MM-DD
### Added
- Initial release with basic functionality.

```

## Logging
The project should includes a logging setup to capture key information, warnings, and errors during execution, which is useful for debugging and monitoring the behavior of the scripts.

```
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format="%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s",
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler("project.log"),    # Log to a file
        logging.StreamHandler()                # Log to the console
    ]
)

# Example usage
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info("Starting the script...")
```
